---> Netlify is web service that offers hosting for free (as long as you keep .netlify.app in the adress bar) and other things such as backend services for web apps and static websites.

---> You can also clone these files and open it on your local machine by following these steps:

     1) If you are using VS Code (which I recommend) you should install Live Server extension.
     2) Then, you should install node_modules by using following command in your terminal: npm install
     3) To open the website, you can right click in index.html file and choose "Open with Live Server" or you can click Go Live in the bottom right corner in VS Code

HOW TO PLAY:

- 2 players can play this game
- 1st player rolls the dice and if he gets any number above 1, he then rolls the dice again and sums those numbers until he gets a 1
- when a player gets 1, then the player 2 starts rolling the dice and collecting points
- first who reaches 100 points is a winner !! :D
- - IMPORATANT \* - player must collect points by using "HOLD" button before he gets the 1, because if he did not collected points and got a 1, then all points that he had previously will be deleted
